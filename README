This is an old proyect I wrote in 2007.

Both (client and server) run in Windows environment.

Client listens in a port, and server makes a reverse connection to act as a backdoor.

The client is written in C and server is written in ASM.

Nowadays it supports the following commands:

* Close the backdoor
* Show available commands
* Launch a reverse shell
* Close the reverse shell
* Make screenshots
* Upload a file to remote FTP server
* Download files from FTP server
* Download files from HTTP server

NOTE: The server doesn't provide host infection
